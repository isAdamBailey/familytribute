# Welcome!

When I walked into that old museum and saw those cheaply-bound books full of family stories that had been 
typed 20 years ago, then photocopied hundreds of times in order to share with aunts and uncles, I knew
there had to be a better way.

## Sharing who you are honoring

We love being able to share memories of those who have passed, on their birthdays, anniversaries, etc.
But sometimes it's too hard to take a picture of their obituary with your phone. Or the newspaper website
that it used to be on, is no longer working, or is now behind a paywall.

There are no ads, there is no paywall. you can link your friends on social media right to a url with 
your loved-ones name. The page includes an obituary, and any pictures and stories that may be
connected to them in the site.

## Contribute together

Sometimes two individuals have very different memories of how something happened. Maybe some things need to get 
"worked out" once you've shared details about a relative. That's great! Let them register to the site and make the 
corrections themselves. 

From within the HistoryFam dashboard, you can add new pictures, stories, and obituaries. Add as many as you want.
You can link the pictures and stories right to a person with an obituary. Link as many people as you want in one
picture, it will show for all their "pages".

## Thanks for reading!
I started building family history websites when one of my Grandfathers was growing old. I was also learning
how to write software at the time, and used sharing the history as means to display open-source work in order
to get a job. I created a few variations of the Hansen History website (linked on the sidebar).
This is a work of honor and love for history more than anything else.

Finally - HistoryFam is currently a work in progress. The software cannot yet be utilized at this time, but Its hoped 
that it can be shared very soon...
