# Current Tributes

The families who have agreed to show their family history publicly. These are great examples of how your own family history might look!

### Hansen FamilyTribute
The Hansen family has a wealth of incredible historical photos and stories going back into the 1880's in the area of 
North Clark County, Washington, and they are proud to share their history!

### Bailey FamilyTribute
This is an example of the site without as many pictures or stories, but a showcase for a family's obituaries
in the Woodland, Washington area.
